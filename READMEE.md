Answer:First, create a new folder on your computer, name it as you like, then enter the song guessing game
Select *Start Guessing*-*Select Song List*, then a **File Selection Box** will pop up, find the folder where you put the song and click **OK** on it

## Occurrence *There is no .mp3 file in the /MusicList folder or there is no . /MusicList directory, please check* how to do?
Answer:First of all, find the directory where you installed the song-guessing game, create a new folder called MusicList, and put the .MP3 music in it.

# ! Note!
Support only MP3 format music, other formats will cause no sound (in the program), if you do not have MP3 format music. Please use Format Factory to convert by yourself(Sometimes after converting to .MP3 may still have no sound, Please first convert the good MP3 to WMA format and then convert to MP3.)
